Modified the Complex World game on Ancient Brain , so that now the enemy bot tracks the agent bot using A* algorithm

The Complex World is a game on Ancient Brain where the enemy bot tracks the agent bot and tries to trap it in the mazes 
provided in the game. 
Below is the link to the Complex World game on Ancient Brain : https://run.ancientbrain.com/run.php?world=complex&mind=complex&userid=kush&dataticket=00595865993158901802209649641871

In the starter version of the Complex World the enemy bot is not very smart and it not able to
trap the agent. I have modified the program so that the enemy now moves using A* algorithm towards the agent. 
After the modification the enemy is able to quickly trap the agent bot.
